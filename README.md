## 🔍 Abstract

Accurate stock price prediction remains a critical challenge due to the complex and volatile nature of financial markets. Traditional techniques often struggle with capturing long-term dependencies and nonlinear patterns. This research utilizes LSTM networks to forecast future stock prices based on historical data.

The methodology involved:

* **Rigorous data preprocessing**, including feature selection and normalization
* **Input sequence creation** for time series modeling
* **Hyperparameter optimization** using grid search
* **Model training over 100 epochs** with strong validation and testing phases

The model achieved an accuracy of **98%** in forecasting future stock prices, outperforming conventional models by capturing complex temporal dependencies. This approach holds practical significance for enhancing decision-making in dynamic market conditions.
